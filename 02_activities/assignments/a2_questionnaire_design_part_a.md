# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
Identify most popular reasons of dissatisfaction between entry-level and lower-lever employees in different departments. This will help to target the underlying reasons and increase the retention and satisfaction of employees. 
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
The target population - are all current and past entry-lewel and low-level positions employees from different departments. 
Sampling frame - list of currently work for the company entry-lewel and low-level positions employees from different departments.
Sample unit - individual entry-lewel and low-level positions employee.
Observational units - each individual employee that responded to the survey. 
My sampling strategy - stratified sampling. All entry-lewel and lower-level employees will be classified into length-of-tenure stratas (<1 year, 1-2 years, 2-3 years, >3 years). After that I will be pulling random samples from this stratas to distribute the survey. 
 
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. Rate your satisfaction of working for our company from 1 to 10, where 10 is highly positive and 1 is highly negative. 
2. Rate the feedback you recieve from your manager or mentor from 1 to 10, where 10 is highly positive and 1 is highly negative.

6. List the challenging or dissatisfying aspect of your work (work-life balance, compensation and benefits, career development, work environment, management and communication, feedback) Rate them from 1 to 10 where 10 is highly dissatisfying. 
7. Do you feel fairly supported and compensated for your work? Yes or No.
