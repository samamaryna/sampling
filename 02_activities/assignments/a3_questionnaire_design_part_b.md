# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
Yes, the sample should be representative of the target population. Stratified sampling ensures that employees from each length-of-tenure group are proportionately included, which minimizes bias and ensures a well-rounded understanding of dissatisfaction among employees with different level of experience. 
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
In my previous submission (https://github.com/samamaryna/sampling/blob/9bf9c7f1218ac193bf1ac3cda429f3180bffc6b7/02_activities/assignments/a2_questionnaire_design_part_a.md) I would change a few questions: 

6. List the challenging or dissatisfying aspect of your work (work-life balance, compensation and benefits, career development, work environment, management and communication, feedback) Rate them from 1 to 10 where 10 is highly dissatisfying. 
Instead of making it multiple choise question, I would make it multiple questions, like: 
How would you rate work-life balance from 1 to 10 where 1 is satisfying and 10 is highly dissatisfying?
How would you rate compensation and benefits from 1 to 10 where 1 is satisfying and 10 is highly dissatisfying?
How would you rate career development from 1 to 10 where 1 is satisfying and 10 is highly dissatisfying?
How would you rate work environment from 1 to 10 where 1 is satisfying and 10 is highly dissatisfying?
How would you rate management and communication from 1 to 10 where 1 is satisfying and 10 is highly dissatisfying?
How would you rate feedback from 1 to 10 where 1 is satisfying and 10 is highly dissatisfying?


7. Do you feel fairly supported and compensated for your work? Yes or No. 
I would change the 7th question too, instead of a double-barrel question I leave just compensated:
Do you feel fairly compensated for your work? Yes or No. 


8. Select three things that can enhance your job satisfaction: work-life balance, compensation and benefits, career development, work environment, management and communication, feedback. 
I would delete this question from my survey. The 6 question has all of these things. 

10. Rate the culture and work environment within the company from 1 to 10, where 10 is highly positive and 1 is highly negative. 
I wouldsplit this question to two. 
Rate the work environment within the company from 1 to 10, where 10 is highly positive and 1 is highly negative. 
AND
Rate the work environment within the company from 1 to 10, where 10 is highly positive and 1 is highly negative. 
    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
   I think that the observational study could take much more time to gain all the insights that we can get from the survey. We can observe behaviours, relationships between entry-level and low-level employees, but survey will get us more details about how we can improve the satisfaction and retention of these employees. 
    ```

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
